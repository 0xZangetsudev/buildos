The lba_to_chs subroutine in the provided assembly code
is responsible for converting a Logical Block Address (LBA)
to a Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS) address. It performs
the conversion by dividing the LBA by the number of sectors per track and heads
to determine the cylinder and head, respectively.



The subroutine begins by pushing the ax and dx registers onto the stack to preserve their values.

The xor dx, dx instruction clears the dx register to zero, preparing it for division.

The div word [bdb_sectors_per_track] instruction divides the value in ax (which holds the LBA) by the number of sectors per track, obtained from the variable bdb_sectors_per_track. The quotient (cylinder) is stored in ax, and the remainder (sector) is stored in dx.

The inc dx instruction increments the dx register to obtain the correct sector number (LBA % SectorsPerTrack + 1).

The mov cx, dx instruction moves the sector number into the cx register.

The xor dx, dx instruction again clears the dx register for division.

The div word [bdb_heads] instruction divides the value in ax (which holds the previous quotient) by the number of heads, obtained from the variable bdb_heads. The quotient (cylinder) is stored in ax, and the remainder (head) is stored in dx.

The mov dh, dl instruction moves the head number into the dh register.

The mov ch, al instruction moves the lower 8 bits of the cylinder number into the ch register.

The shl ah, 6 instruction shifts the upper 2 bits of the cylinder number in ah to the left by 6 positions.

The or cl, ah instruction combines the shifted upper bits of the cylinder with the lower 6 bits of the cylinder in cl, resulting in a 8-bit cylinder value in cx.

The pop ax instruction restores the original value of ax from the stack.

The mov dl, al instruction moves the value in al (which holds the original dx value) to dl.

The pop ax instruction restores the original value of ax from the stack.

Finally, the ret instruction returns control to the calling code.
